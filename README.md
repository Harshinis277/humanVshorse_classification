# humanVshorse_classification
This project uses deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either horses or humans. The model aims to accurately distinguish between images containing horses and those containing humans. CNNs are effective for this task because they can learn to recognize patterns and features in images, helping automate the classification process.
